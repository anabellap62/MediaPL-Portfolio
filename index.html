<h1>Anabella Pichardo's Portfolio</h1>
<p>My work begins at the heartbeat of Mott Haven, a community in the south Bronx.Where small businesses line up with its streetsâ€” symbols of hope, testaments of perseverance. Where others see simple places of eateries, salons, and bodega. I see the cascading rhythm of immigrant families. Through film and photography you will see a homage to the sleepless nights and early mornings. Where a city that never sleeps has dark circles and spider veins. Childhood memories of running in between the aisle while helping your father restock the shelves. Each frame is a portrait and a poem. Preserving what is overlooked, casting a shadow on the spectacle of business. Shining a light on dark days where all people can hang on is hope. To strengthen the conviction of what they have not seen. </p>
