  <h1>Reading Reflections</h1>
  <h2>Susan Sontag's On photography</h2>
  <p>Susan Sontang’s essay “In Plato’s Cave” offers a conspicuous perspective on what it means to capture images. She challenges the common beliefs of the validity of pictures when it is compared to reality. Reminding us that photographs are fragments; a brief representation of reality. Yet, in this shadow of reality, they carry a great power and even greater limitations. N their strength they have the ability to persuade, document, and shape memory. However the thorn of their rose of strength is the inability to tell the complete truth. With the risk of sounding like a pun, one might say, they don’t show the full picture. And though this text was written decades ago, she makes an interesting point that the ubiquity of image making has significantly changed the way we experience and interpret reality. 

Normally, I don’t walk around thinking of the profundity of each image I take. Especially those that I take on my cell phone. However, days later I find their existence of great value. Especially when it is a memory that I refuse to forget. When I take a photograph I am often motivated by the desire to hold on to something fleeting. Yet as Sontang points out this act alone is already a  transformation. The true experience is not kept, but the surface of the full experience. The emotions of a special day or the presence of a loved one is never replaced with a photograph, it is simply a vessel to hold bits and pieces of what was. Still, I will likely continue to build these vessels, as they hold more than memories at times; they hold hope. 

Beyond preservation, image-making is also a tool for commentary. An example would be a carousel post on instagram. At the peak of the Israel-Palestine war, many were using a carousel of pictures to show the destruction in both counties. Both use this to persuade an audience to side with them and condemn the other side. The sequence of these images, with and without text, caused a stir. A single photograph can document who was present, even where they were. However when combined with text or other illustrations, it can convey an actual message. Without these, the rhetoric that is needed to convey a clearer picture is simply not possible with just a camera. 

Within these ten projects it is honestly a bit daunting to see how it will all come together as a single body of work. With the help of graphics, text, and tonality—- I believe that I can create a cohesive story that conveys the complete message I’d like to present. Understanding that many interpretations can exist at the same time. It is not solely about what I capture. But about how I encourage others to perceive what has been captured. if , as Sontag suggests, we line in Plato’s cave of images, then perhaps my goal may need to shift. Not to create images that merely project shades of reality, but hint at the light beyond them.
